# Adding Events to the R-Ladies Chicago Website
    
## About our website  
  
The R-Ladies Chicago chapter website can be found at [rladieschicago.org](https://rladieschicago.org/). It uses the Hugo [Academic Theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/).  
  
  
## Events  
  
Events are posted to our website as "Talks" (i.e. using the talks widget in the academic theme). The `Website_Event_Template.md` file in this repo is the template for creating new events.   
  
Upon filling out the website template, please rename the `.md` file as the date of the meetup and the meetup name. More specifically:  
  
* If the event is a regular, in-person meetup, the file name should be: **YYYY-MM-DD-Meetup.md**   
* If the event is a study group meeting, the file name should be: **YYYY-MM-DD-SGNAME.md** (i.e.   
  2018-07-09_NLP.md)  
  
Place this file and any source files (i.e. images) in the folder labelled **Ready for Website** in this repo and let the webmaster know that you have included files there. When files have been added to the website, they will be removed from this folder.    
   
   
### Some other nuances  
  
For maintaining consistency, use the following conventions when filling out certain fields of the template:  
  
*In the header:*  
  
For `title = ""` use the name of the event that matches with what is posted on our meetup page. If this is a study group meeting or a smaller meeting that might not be posted on meetup, writing "Astrostatistics Study Group Meeting" is sufficient.  
  
For `event = ""` start with the sub-group that's meeting, the month, then the type of event. For example:  
  
* For meetups, the event field should say: *R-Ladies Chicago MONTH EVENT_TYPE[Technical/Social] Meetup*  
     E.g. **R-Ladies Chicago August Technical Meetup**  
* For study groups, the event field should say: *Study Group Name MONTH Meeting*   
     E.g. **NLP Study Group August Meeting**  
  

The longer event description should include:  
  
* A 1-sentence summary about what the event is (this could be the text that is used on the meetup event)  
* An email or method of contact if someone wants more information
